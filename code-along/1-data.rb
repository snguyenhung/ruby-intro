# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb
# puts "Hello, world"

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 7

# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5 + 2

# Strings
# puts "tacos"
# puts "tacos" * 3
# puts "tacos" + 3 -> error
# puts "3 tacos"

# Combine strings together
# puts "#{3+3+3} tacos"

# Variables
# quantity = 3 + 3 + 3
# food = "tacos"

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "#{quantity} #{food}"

# String manipulation
# puts "Hello".reverse
