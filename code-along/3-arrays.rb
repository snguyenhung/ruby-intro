# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
# puts favorite_foods

we_have_to_go_back = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
# puts we_have_to_go_back

mixed_array = ["tacos", 12, true]
# puts mixed_array

shopping_list = [["milk", "eggs", "toilet paper"], ["shampoo", "toilet paper"]]
# puts shopping_list [0][1]

# Accessing the array
favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
# puts favorite_foods[0]

# Add to the array
favorite_foods.push("sushi")
favorite_foods = favorite_foods + ["burgers"]
# puts favorite_foods

# puts favorite_foods.count

# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
